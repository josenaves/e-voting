# e-Voting 

## Description

This project is a Solana PDA responsible for controlling a simplified e-voting system.

The "chairperson" (assembly leader / administrator) can create a proposal to be voted on.

The proposal has a description, number of votes for NO, number of votes for YES, and a flag indicating it is ongoing.

The voters can vote just one time for each proposal. 

The chairperson can close the voting proposal at any time.
